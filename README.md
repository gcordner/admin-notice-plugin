# Toggle Admin Notices

A simple WordPress plugin that allows you to toggle the visibility of admin notices globally. Especially useful for plugin-heavy WooCommerce sites where excessive admin notices can slow down the backend.

## Description

Sometimes, especially on WooCommerce sites with a lot of plugins installed, an excessive number of admin notices can cause the backend to slow down. This plugin provides a quick and easy way to hide all admin notices in the WordPress dashboard, helping improve performance and reduce clutter.

## Features

- Globally hide or show all admin notices for all users.
- Easy toggle switch located under **Settings > Admin Notices Toggle**.
- Perfect for plugin-heavy sites, especially WooCommerce.

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/toggle-admin-notices` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Navigate to **Settings > Admin Notices Toggle** to turn off or on all admin notices.

## Usage

Once activated, go to **Settings > Admin Notices Toggle** in your WordPress dashboard. There, you will find an option to toggle the visibility of admin notices. When admin notices are hidden, they are hidden for all users across the site.

## Notes

This plugin is particularly useful for sites with a large number of plugins, as too many admin notices can contribute to backend performance issues. Simply turn them off when not needed and re-enable them as necessary.
